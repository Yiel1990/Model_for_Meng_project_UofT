Note: Before running the code, please firstly run the setup.py to extract the model file.

Function of each file:
evaluate.py is used for showing the performance for each individual model on the private test set on Fer2013 data set.
cnn_multiple_evaluation.py is used for showing the performance for our multiple convolution neural network model on the private test set on Fer2013 data set.
load_data.py is used for laoding image data from the directory.
model.py stores the structure for individual model.
predict.py is used for predicting the type of expression given an image, the command is like "python predict.py imagefile"
processing.py is used for preprocessing the image file.
cnn_ICML.py, cnn_VGG.py and cnn_VGG_19 are used for trainning each individual model.

Performance:
Our multiple convolution neural network can gain an accuracy about 71.13% on private test set of Fer2013, which is only slightly lower than the state-of-art method that can gain about 72%.

Usage of the model:
I use this model to develop an android application which can determine the type of expression for the people given the image.

Next work:
The future work is to replace the softmax layer with SVM classifier to further improve the performance.
